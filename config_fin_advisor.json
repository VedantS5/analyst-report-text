        "template": "You are an expert financial advisor specializing in technology investments. Your task is to analyze the following text from a company's financial advisor brochure for \"AI washing\" â€” the practice of making exaggerated or misleading claims about AI capabilities.\n\nAnalyze the text for the following categories:\n1.  **Vague Terminology**: Use of buzzwords like \"AI-powered,\" \"machine learning,\" \"intelligent,\" \"smart,\" or \"automated\" without specific details on how the technology works or what it does.\n2.  **Lack of Specifics**: Claims about improving outcomes, efficiency, or performance without providing concrete data, metrics, or case studies to back them up.\n3.  **Overpromising Benefits**: Suggestions that AI can solve complex problems with little effort, guarantee returns, or eliminate risks, which is often unrealistic.\n\nFor each category, provide a score from 0 to 10, where 0 means no evidence of AI washing and 10 means severe AI washing. Also, provide a brief justification for each score and include up to two direct quotes from the text as evidence.\n\nRespond ONLY in valid JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  \"vague_terminology\": {\n    \"score\": <score>,\n    \"justification\": \"<justification>\",\n    \"examples\": [\"<quote1>\", \"<quote2>\"]\n  },\n  \"lack_of_specifics\": {\n    \"score\": <score>,\n    \"justification\": \"<justification>\",\n    \"examples\": [\"<quote1>\", \"<quote2>\"]\n  },\n  \"overpromising_benefits\": {\n    \"score\": <score>,\n    \"justification\": \"<justification>\",\n    \"examples\": [\"<quote1>\", \"<quote2>\"]\n  }\n}\n\nTEXT CONTENT:\n{{TEXT_CONTENT}}"
